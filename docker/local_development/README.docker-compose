HOW TO RUN

This docker-compose is intended for testing purposes or for running the app from
your local pc. This install creates docker images for psgui frontend and psproxy
backend. For running this app in production follow README.md from the front
page of the psgui and psproxy repos.

Clone latest psgui from github:

git clone https://github.com/perfsonar/psgui.git

Enter docker subdirectory. There are two config files in two subdirectories.
You can leave everything as it is if you want to try it with GÃ‰ANT PMP nodes.

In subdirectory psproxy there is custom_config.py. You can change url in psproxy
config file to get nodes from your maddash. This is all you have to do if you
simply want to try the app with your maddash instance.

In subdirectory psgui there is custom_TestDefaultValues.js. You can change URLs
for production there or add custom perfsonar hosts out of your maddash instance.
It is a json file, just check geant_nodes key - add more hosts with label and
value keypairs.

Make sure you have docker-compose installed and run

docker-compose up --build -d

from docker subdirectory.

After the build is finished you are supposed to have two working docker containers.
Access localhost:3000 and you'll have working app.

Stop everything with:

docker-compose down
